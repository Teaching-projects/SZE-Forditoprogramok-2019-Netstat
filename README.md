# Netstat Output Interpreter

### The purpose of this small project is to create a parser that is able to parse the [netstat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstat) command line program's output, when it is called with the -apn arguments.

### Structure of the repository

* **Makefile**: Standard [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile). Its a programmable descriptor of the steps that are necessary to build the project.

* **netstat.l**: [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)) file. Contains the tokens and the actions that need to be executed when the generated lexer face with one of the tokens that could occur in the parsable input.

* **netstat.y**: [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison) file. Contains the necessary grammar and actions in [BNF form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

* **sample**: It is an example file that contains a simple netstat -apn output in a file.

### Requirements and how to build the project

  ##### Requirements:
    flex, bison, [gcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)

  ##### Install on ubuntu systems:
    apt-get update && apt-get install bison flex build-essential

  ##### Build:
    make

   The binary will be available with name **netstat_parser**

  #### Test:
    echo "tcp        0      0 192.168.123.125:52934   192.168.123.41:22       ESTABLISHED 57703/ssh" | ./netstat_parser

### Transitional generatums

  * **lex.yy.c**: It is the generated lexer from netstat.l by flex.
  * **netstat.tab.c, netstat.tab.h**: Generated by bison and contains token type names defined in grammar, some extern variable declarations and it is necessarry for yylex which is called by the scanner.
